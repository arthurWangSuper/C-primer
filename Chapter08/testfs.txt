I came out alone on my way to my tryst.
But who is this that follows me in the silent dark?
I move aside to avoid his presence but i escape him not.
He makes the dust rise from the earth with his swagger;he adds his loud voice to every word that i utter.
He is my own little self,my lord,he knows no shame;but i am ahsamed to come to thy door in his company.
